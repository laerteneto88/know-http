# Know HTTP

## About

The intuition of this document is to explain a little about HTTP (not so hard) in a way that people can understand easily the concepts. 

## How

A document like poster with friendly UI and examples that get straight to the point in concepts.

## Why

The idea started when I saw this [link](http://www.steveschoger.com/status-code-poster/) and thought: Why not a HTML of this with a nice view and easily to understand. I think this will help people who not know's the basics about HTTP.
